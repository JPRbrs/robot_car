* Creating a Raspberry Access point
** Get minibian and burn it onto the sdcard
  delete partitions on sd card with gparted
  dd bs=4M if=image_file.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p conv=fsync
** Expand the partition
  [[https://minibianpi.wordpress.com/how-to/resize-sd/]]
  an easier way to do it is install raspi-config
** Install emacs, tmux, git, sudo, pip, python
  send emacs and tmux config
** Setting up access point
  you'll need to install dhcpd and iptables along with dnsmasq and hostapd   [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md][reference]]
** It looks like the connection is not stable with the phone. I've made wlan0 static as follows:
Add this to interfaces
iface wlan0 inet static 
    address 192.168.4.1 
    netmask 255.255.255.0

sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.42.1
sudo reboot
** Building temporary server to prove we can connect to the access point and use websockets
** Find how to connect raspberry with Arduino so rpi sends orders to arduino
