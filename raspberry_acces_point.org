* Creating a Raspberry Access point
** Get minibian and burn it onto the sdcard
  delete partitions on sd card and burn the image
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  sudo fdisk /dev/<device>
  dd bs=4M if=image_file.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p conv=fsync
  #+END_SRC
** Install raspi-config and expand the partition
   [[https://minibianpi.wordpress.com/how-to/resize-sd/]] or use raspi-config
** Update to strech
   [[https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-upgrade-debian-8-jessie-to-debian-9-stretch][source]]
** Install emacs, tmux, git, sudo, pip, python
** Setting up access point
  you'll need to install dhcpd and iptables along with dnsmasq and hostapd   [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md][reference]]
** It looks like the connection is not stable with the phone. I've made wlan0 static as follows:
Add this to interfaces
iface wlan0 inet static 
    address 192.168.4.1 
    netmask 255.255.255.0

sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.42.1
sudo reboot
** Building temporary server to prove we can connect to the access point and use websockets
** Find how to connect raspberry with Arduino so rpi sends orders to arduino
see [[https://nanpy.github.io/][nanpi]]
*** Download and configure Nanpi
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:nanpy/nanpy-firmware.git
cd nanpy-firmware
./configure.sh
#+END_SRC

Now copy Nanpy folder to your arduino sketch folder (you can find that out on Arduino -> file -> preferences.
Then connect to your arduino and updload the Nanpy sketch.

Run nanpy_test.py to check you can communicate with the Arduino using nanpy
