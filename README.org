Provisional shopping list:
- arduino board   got it
- motor board
  Check it has pass through for unused pins
  Check it has libraries for arduino available
- distance sensor got it
- protoboard      got it, might need a smaller one
- vehicle kit     must include wheels motor batteries will be bought separately

- github
- documentation?
- unit testing for C (or the language arduino uses)
